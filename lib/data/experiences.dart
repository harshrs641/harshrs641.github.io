      description: "IRDE(a DRDO establishment), was developing a fever screening system. The system uses a normal camera to capture video and anIR Camera to detect temperature. I worked on developing the software and integrating it with the hardware. My work involveddetecting faces in the RGB video and scale these inputs to match the scale of the IR camera such that temperature of only thefacial regions could be extracted for which I used deep learning. A few parameters also change as the temperature of the IR camerachanges when it is in use. I developed machine learning algorithms to automatically adjust the parameters so as to give the correctoutput. I also developed a GUI in python\n\n"),

          '- I interned at IRDE, a DRDO establishment. My work involved digital image processing, computer vision and automatic target detection using background differencing, frame differencing, and difference fusion. An algorithm was also developed by me for automatic detection of moving ground targets, viz. vehicle, human, etc. in image sequences captured by an infrared (thermal) imaging system. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can detect intruding targets in infrared imaging video with good accuracy\n\n'),
